* INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS *
*****************************

VDBT is installed as part of the BC5 install. Please refer to 
the file README.TXT in the \BC5 directory on your CD.

This install will automatically install the 32-bit version of the 
Borland Database engine. If you require the shipping 16-bit version, 
please run SETUP.EXE from the SETUP\IDAPI16 directory. 

  * 16 BIT BORLAND DATABASE ENGINE

  Procedure
  ---------

  Most times you will be installing VDBT on a machine that already contains 
  the 16 bit BDE software. The 16-bit release of BDE contained in VDBT is the 
  certified, shipping release, rev 2.51.

  To use VDBT on a machine which has an installation of a Borland product 
  which already contains the BDE:

  1) Install BC5.0 with VDBT

  2) Run setup.exe from the SETUP\IDAPI16 directory on your BC5.0 CD.

  3) Placement of BDE files:
    
  If you are installing VDBT on a workstation that already contains a copy of the 
  Borland Database Engine, install VDBT's BDE files to the same directory. Normally 
  this directory is called \IDAPI.
    
  If you have an existing installation of the BDE, the installation program copies 
  your default BDE configuration file to whatever location you specified for your 
  VDBT BDE files.  (Your default BDE configuration file is specified in the BDE 
  section of your WIN.INI file as CONFIGFILE01.) 
    
  If the CONFIGFILE01 setting does not exist in your WIN.INI and you do not have an 
  IDAPI.CFG file, a new IDAPI.CFG file is created in the same directory where you 
  installed your VDBT BDE files. The installation program changes the CONFIGFILE01 
  setting to point to IDAPI.CFG at this new location.

  *  32 BIT BORLAND DATABASE ENGINE

  Procedure
  ---------
  This is automatically installed as part of the BC5.0 install. 

  If you are upgrading a Windows 3.1 Installation, the SETUP program 
  will detect and upgrade your existing configuration if you have one. 
  We recommend that you back up your configuration first before installing 
  this software.

  Upgrading Configuration Files
  -----------------------------

  WIN.INI parameters and system and driver configuration information 
  from the IDAPI.CFG file have been moved to the Registry on 
  WinNT and Win95.  The information remaining in the IDAPI.CFG 
  file is the alias information.
  If you have an existing IDAPI.CFG file that you want to merge 
  into the registry, you can use the BDECFG32.EXE utility to 
  import the IDAPI.CFG file.  Follow these steps:

     i)   Run BDECFG32.EXE.
     ii)  Select the File|Open menu item.In the Open File dialog 
          box, select the IDAPI.CFG file you wish to merge into 
          the registry.
     iii) Once the file is loaded, select the File|Save option.
     iv)  A dialog box appears, titled "Save configuration file".  
          If you select "Save for only 32bit applications", the 
          utility will copy system and driver information to the 
          registry and remove it from the IDAPI.CFG file.  The 
          IDAPI.CFG file will no longer be usable by a 16-bit 
          Windows 3.1 program.
          If you select "Save for both 16bit and 32bit applications", 
          the utility will copy system and driver information to 
          the registry and also write the information to the .CFG 
          file. This way, the IDAPI.CFG file will be usable by 
          both 16-bit and 32-bit programs.
     V)   If your IDAPI.CFG file contained aliases, those aliases 
          will still be in the IDAPI.CFG file.
    
************************************************************
* 16-BIT BORLAND DATABASE ENGINE (BDE) CONFIGURATION NOTES *
************************************************************

If another 16-bit BDE-based product is already running when you 
start VDBT, VDBT will use the BDE configuration file that is 
already active. 
    
Choose the BDE Configuration Utility icon from Windows Program Manager 
to edit the configuration file. When you open the utility it will display 
the IDAPI.CFG specified in the IDAPI section of the WIN.INI file. If you 
have other Borland products installed that use a different configuration 
file and you want to change the parameters in that file, you must use 
File|Open to explicitly open the file.
    
Depending on the types of files you are accessing, you might need to 
change some or all of the following IDAPI.CFG settings:
    
  - DBASE FILE TYPE -- During installation, if a BDE configuration file 
    exists on your machine, its settings are read into the new BDE
    configuration file. This may cause the dBASE FILE TYPE level to be 
    set to 4. To use the new Visual dBASE field types, set DBASE FILE TYPE 
    to 5. 
    
  - LOCAL SHARE -- If you do not access any other Borland database software 
    over a network, you need to set LOCAL SHARE (System Page) to TRUE to 
    use both VDBT and any non-BDE Borland products that may access a 
    table at the same time. 
    
  - NET DIR -- If you are using Paradox tables on a shared drive (network), 
    you must enter a valid path into the IDAPI.CFG's Paradox driver 
    NET DIR setting.  See the instructions above on how to use the BDE 
    Configuration Utility.
